# AL360CLI
Alemismun's 360VR YoutubeDL companion CLI program. Lets you download 360 youtube videos!  

## How to install
1. Create a folder with the youtube-dl and ffmpeg binaries (the .exe files) inside of it
2. Drop AL360CLI into the folder too
3. Run AL360 CLI, a CMD (a terminal window) will show up and guide you through its usage

## How to use
To use it, simply paste the link to a 360VR video (sorry, no 180VR support, if you know a solution, please let me know!) and then follow the steps provided by the CLI itself. If you want to watch videos at a lower resolution (for example, if you are using an old mobile phone), download the video using the best settings and then drag and drop the video file into AL360CLI.bat (not the window, but the program on file explorer itself), this will convert it to 720p at a high speed with little quality loss.

## Is this safe?
Probably. The code is there, you can look at it if you want.  
It is probably possible to screw something up if you use it wrong. No guarantees of safety or satisfaction provided.
